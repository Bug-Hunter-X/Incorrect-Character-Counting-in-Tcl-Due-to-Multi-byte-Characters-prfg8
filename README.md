This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when counting characters in strings containing multi-byte characters (such as UTF-8). The provided Tcl script `bug.tcl` attempts to count characters using the `split` command, which operates on bytes, not Unicode characters.  The solution, `bugSolution.tcl`, shows how to accurately count characters by using the `string length` command, which handles multi-byte characters correctly. This example highlights a subtle but potentially significant issue when dealing with internationalization and character encoding in Tcl applications.
